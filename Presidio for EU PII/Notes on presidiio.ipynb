    "What it is: \n",
    "Presidio is an open-source tool designed for detecting and anonymizing Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: \n",
    "It uses a combination of rule-based recognizers (regex, context words) and NLP models to detect sensitive data like names, phone numbers, credit card numbers, email addresses, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "What it supports out of the box: \n",
    "Mostly U.S.-centric PII types (e.g. SSNs, U.S. phone numbers, U.S. zip codes), butâ€¦\n",
    "\n",
    "You can extend it: \n",
    "You can add custom recognizers and tweak detection logic to support international PII types (e.g. EU National IDs, local phone/address formats).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus: It also has redaction/anonymization capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caveat: Like all automated tools, itâ€™s not 100% accurate and can miss things or return false positivesâ€”so it should be part of a broader data governance and protection strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what: \n",
    "Presidio wasnâ€™t exactly born in Brusselsâ€”so it leans heavily on U.S.-centric PII types like SSNs and U.S. phone numbers. Thatâ€™s fine for some, but for global customersâ€”particularly in GDPR-bound regionsâ€”it leaves a big compliance gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook in this directory  test EU-specific PII detection with Presidio, covering ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spain, ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· France, ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany, and ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Italy â€” including things like DNI, Codice Fiscale, INSEE numbers, and Steuer-ID."

# Responsible AI Toolkit for Databricks  (RAID)

## Overview  
Welcome to the **Responsible AI Toolkit for Databricks**, a growing collection of tools and resources to help organizations build, monitor, and maintain Responsible AI solutions on Databricks.  

This repository is designed to support AI practitioners, data scientists, and compliance teams in meeting the stringent requirements of ethical AI deployment, including compliance with frameworks such as the new **EU AI Act**.  

### Initial Focus: High-Risk Machine Learning Auditing  
The first set of tools included in this repository is tailored for auditing and reporting **High-Risk Machine Learning** systems, as defined by the EU AI Act. These tools help ensure compliance by enabling:  

- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logs and records for High-Risk AI systems.  
- **Explainability Reporting**: Documenting decision-making processes and ensuring transparency.  
- **Bias and Fairness Assessments**: Identifying and mitigating unfair biases in ML models.  
- **Risk Assessment Templates**: Prebuilt frameworks to classify and assess risks.  

### Why This Toolkit?  
With regulations like the EU AI Act imposing stringent requirements for auditing High-Risk AI systems, organizations need robust solutions to ensure compliance. This toolkit is specifically built for **Databricks** users, leveraging the platform's capabilities to streamline Responsible AI practices.  

## Features (Planned Additions)  
Beyond High-Risk ML auditing, the toolkit aims to include:  
1. Tools for ongoing **AI compliance monitoring**.  
2. Frameworks for implementing **ethical AI principles**.  
3. Integration examples for **governance workflows** on Databricks.  
4. Best practices for deploying **transparent and fair AI systems**.  

## Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/lherrear-db/RAID.git
